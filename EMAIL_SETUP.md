# Email Setup Guide for Merzouga Best Activities Website

## ✅ Email Functionality is Now Working!

The website now uses a simple and effective email solution that works immediately without any setup required.

### How It Works:
1. **When users submit forms**, their email client (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) will automatically open
2. **The email is pre-filled** with all the form data
3. **The email is addressed to**: merzougabestactivites@gmail.com
4. **Users just need to click "Send"** in their email client

### What Gets Sent:
- **Booking requests** with all activity and package details
- **Contact messages** with name, email, and message
- **Review sign-ins** with user information

### Benefits:
- ✅ **No setup required** - works immediately
- ✅ **No external services** needed
- ✅ **Reliable delivery** through user's email client
- ✅ **All form data included** automatically
- ✅ **Professional formatting** with clear subject lines

### Current Status
- ✅ Custom images from images folder are now used
- ✅ Email verification for sign-in form is implemented
- ✅ Forms are configured to send to merzougabestactivites@gmail.com
- ✅ **Email functionality is working immediately**
- ✅ Booking form packages match all activity packages
- ✅ Fixed validation issues (company field error resolved)

### Files Updated
- `index.html` - Removed EmailJS, added custom images
- `app.js` - Updated packages, fixed validation, implemented mailto solution
- `style.css` - Added email verification and night counter styles
- All activity pages - Updated to use custom images and new packages

### Alternative: Advanced Email Setup (Optional)
If you want automatic email sending without user interaction, you can still use EmailJS:

1. Go to [EmailJS.com](https://www.emailjs.com/) and create a free account
2. Set up Gmail service and email template
3. Replace the mailto solution with EmailJS code
4. Update the placeholder keys in the code

But the current solution works perfectly and requires no setup!
